\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}
Virtualization poses an interesting issue for specifications towards trustworthy systems as the \emph{trust} placed originally only in hardware components needs to be extended to reporting and measurement mechanisms in upper layers. While approaches towards trust establishment exist, their semantics are ambiguous and an appraiser has to decide whether a virtualization platform or upper layers are trusted without much guidance or support in reasoning for such a decision. Furthermore, existing attestation approaches imply a particular topology, connectivity, and capability that does not reflect decentralized systems. A \emph{User-Centered Attestation}, as a novel attestation system, encompasses these concerns and proposes a strategy for specifying and synthesizing suitable trust establishment mechanisms and hopefully inspires further research and contributions towards standards for open and collaborative trustworthy systems.
