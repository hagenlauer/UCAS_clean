  Virtualization is omnipresent as the backbone of cloud, edge, and fog computing as well as \emph{X-as-a-service} infrastructure. It continues to gain increased popularity even in edge or end-user and embedded devices. The need for standards and specifications for secure and trustworthy collaboration becomes a pressing issue. Trusted Computing is considered one of the pillars towards trustworthy systems both in terms of practical security mechanisms and supporting standards. This paper revisits the Trusted Computing tool-set and introduces its current application in virtualization scenarios. We discuss challenges related to translating the term \emph{trust} between specifications for hardware modules such as the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) and applied specifications for operating systems, hypervisors, and virtual machines are --- defining trust establishment becomes crucial for specifications extending \emph{trust} beyond the TPM. We define User-centered attestation as a set of principles suitable for layered, decentralized systems along with a methodology for specifying and synthesizing such a trust establishment strategy.
